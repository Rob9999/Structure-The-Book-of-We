# Part I – Inside Us: The Human as Structure

## Chapter 1 – Body, Brain, Patterns
- The human as a dynamic system: nervous system, hormones, habits.
- Why we are more repetition than "free decision."

## Chapter 2 – Psyche, Narrative, Identity
- Inner stories and roles ("I am the one who…").
- How identity stabilizes as a structure (and when it breaks).

## Chapter 3 – Emotions as Structural Signals
- Emotions not as "disturbances" but as feedback from the system.
- Fear, shame, joy, connectedness—read structurally.
